\section*{Task and data}
Our goal is train a deep neural model to determine the language of a document at the \emph{word level}, thus capturing code-switching in the situation where more than one language is assigned to words in the same document.  If code-switching is not a relevant phenomenon, simple majority voting (optionally weighted by likelihood) can be used to choose a language at the document level.  The datasets are:

\section*{Models}

\section*{VaLID}
MODEL DESCRIPTION

\section*{Attention}
The proposed model creates word-level representations by concatenating word embeddings (randomly initialized or pretrained) with an attentional mechanism over characters using absolute positional encoding.  An attention mechanism using \emph{relative} positional encoding is then applied over the sentence to classify the language of each word.

\section*{HOTSPOT}
MODEL DESCRIPTION

\section*{Evaluation}
Performance is quantified in two ways: accuracy via macro F-score, the standard metric in the literature, and calibration via KL-divergence between predicted and empirical marginal class probabilities for unbalanced test data.

\section*{Presentation}
We include confusion matrices as heatmaps showing misclassification rate by language pair, bar charts showing performance by document length, and throughput by hyperparameter values.
